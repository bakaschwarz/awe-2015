Feature: A post request for updating the sensor database
  A post request will be send at a specific address
  That contains an api key and sensor data
  Which will be added to the database

  Background:
    Given the database has a user with the mail "example@example.com" and the password "asdf"
    And the database contains a sensor with the name "sensor_1", the label "temperature" and the unit "Â°C"
    And the database contains an api token

  Scenario: Making a valid post request
    Given there is a JSON File
    And it contains the sensor "sensor_1" and the value "23"
    And it contains the timestamp "1441265184" as well as the node "1"
    And it contains the correct API Token
    When I post it to the server
    Then It will be added to the database

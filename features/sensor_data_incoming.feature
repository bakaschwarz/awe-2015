Feature: A post request for updating the sensor database
  A post request will be send at a specific address
  That contains an api key and sensor data
  Which will be added to the database

  Background:
    Given the database has a user with the mail "example@example.com" and the password "asdf"
    And the user has the API token "coolapitoken"
    And the database contains a sensor with the name "sensor_1", the label "temperature" and the unit "Â°C"

  Scenario: Making a valid post request
    Given there is a JSON File
    And it contains the name "sensor_1" and the value "23"
    And it contains the timestamp "1441265184" as well as the node "1"
    Then the JSON File is inserted into the body of the post request
    And the header of the post request contains the api token "coolapitoken"
    When the post request is send to "/weather_update/create"
    Then the JSON File will be formed into an entry for the database
    And will be inserted

  Scenario: Making an invalid post request
    Given there is a JSON File
    And it contains the name "sensor_1" and the value "23"
    And it contains the timestamp "1441265184" as well as the node "1"
    Then the JSON File is inserted into the body of the post request
    And the header of the post request contains the api token "badapitoken"
    When the post request is send to "/weather_update/create"
    Then the post request will be rejected
